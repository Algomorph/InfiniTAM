This file contains some future plans for online testing. For now, only a single Linux build configuration is tested.

Not all matrix branches need to be tested.

For instance, for dependency source options, if no other 3rd-party package B depends on a certain package A,
then I don't care about trying out every single option for B with every single option for A. Just going through the
configurations for A is enough to test it. However, if some package B depends on A, then all those options must be tested.

Generators:

1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 x64
2. gcc / Makefiles
3. (?) gcc / Ninja

Note: Set <NAME>_FORCE_PREFERRED_SOURCE=TRUE for all dependencies when setting <NAME>_PREFERRED_SOURCE
(Read the following table using monospace font, plz)
